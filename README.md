## üìñ About The Project

This project is a creative exploration of modern web design and animation techniques. The goal was to build a fluid, engaging, and memorable user experience similar to those celebrated on Awwwards. It leverages GSAP for complex timeline-based animations and Locomotive Scroll for smooth, parallax-style scrolling effects.

Key learning and implementation points include:

- Creating a seamless page loader.
- Implementing a custom mouse cursor.
- Triggering animations on scroll events.
- Choreographing text and image reveals for a dynamic feel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project was built using a curated set of modern front-end technologies:

- **[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)**
- **[CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**
- **[JavaScript (ES6+)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**
- **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)**: A professional-grade JavaScript library for high-performance animations.
- **[Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/)**: A library that provides smooth scrolling with parallax effects.

## ‚ú® Features

The website includes a range of carefully crafted features to enhance the user experience:

- **Preloader Animation**: A stylish loading screen that smoothly transitions into the main content.
- **Custom Cursor Follower**: An interactive cursor that changes based on hoverable elements.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Fluid scrolling powered by Locomotive Scroll, creating a premium browsing feel.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Elements, text, and images animate into view as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Text Reveal Effects**: Engaging typography animations that draw the user's attention.
- **Hover-Activated Image Effects**: Interactive effects on links and images upon mouse hover.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: A layout that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
